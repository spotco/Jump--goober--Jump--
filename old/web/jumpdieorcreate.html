		<p><h3>JUMP OR DIE OR CREATE - PLAY WITH ARROW KEYS AND SPACE</h3></p>
		<p><strong>FIRST RELEASE V0.1</strong>- Rankings, comments and message board aren't working yet (top rated is the same as random atm). Also no tutorial past 7. 
		Also menus look pretty bad. Other than that, everything should work. Expect fixes soon, whenever I have time. 
		If you encounter any bugs or somehow manage to html-inject me, email me at: mootothemax@gmail.com</p>
		<p><em>TROUBLESHOOTING: If nothing is working, try clicking on the game. This should make the keys work again. Sorry about that!</em></p>
		
		<p><em>Quick writeup about level editor</em> since there is no ingame help yet. Bottom left corner is the picker for what kind of block you want to create. Select your type and click and drag on the main screen. Z or click undo to delete.
		To make text, click the T box, click anywhere on screen, enter you text and press ok. The bottom 20 pixels of the screen will not try to make a textbox when you
		click on them, click there to get keyboard focus on the game (same bug mentioned above). Boxes must be at least 7pixels wide+think or they don't register.
		<strong>To submit a level, beat it.</strong>This will bring up a window option and just follow the instructions. PS. the tutorials were made in the level editor.</p>
